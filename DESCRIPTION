Description: Reads data collected from wearable acceleratometers as used in sleep and physical activity research. Currently supports file formats: binary data from 'GENEActiv' <https://activinsights.com/>, .bin-format from GENEA devices (not for sale), and .cwa-format from 'Axivity' <https://axivity.com>. Further, it has functions for reading text files with epoch level aggregates from 'Actical', 'Fitbit', 'Actiwatch', 'ActiGraph', and 'PhilipsHealthBand'. Primarily designed to complement R package GGIR <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=GGIR>.

   A package to read data files from wearable accelerometers
}
\description{
  This package offers a collection of functions to read data files from
  wearable accelerometers. Some functions were migrated from R package GGIR
  to make GGIR more modular and to reduce it's complexity, while other functions
  such as readGENEActiv (R) and GENEActivReader (C++) are newly written.
